# Collision_Preimage_Attacks
Program to Test out Pre-image and Collision Attacks

A collision attack in hashing is when an attacker finds two separate source messages that both hash to the same value. The expected time for this attack is 2^(n/2) where n is the number of bits in the hash digest.

A pre-image attack in hashing is when an attacker is given a specific hash value (usually the hash value of an intercepted message) and is asked to find a source message that hashes to that value. The expected time for this attack is 2^n where n is the number of bits in the digest.
